GameOverMenu

Role: Gameplay Menu


Goal: 


The role of the game over is rather simple: provide a screen when the player has died, and allow for either a scene reload or exiting back to the menu.
This function can be useful to trigger re-randomization functions, respawning or resetting elements, and resetting states without having to fully reload
the current scene.
