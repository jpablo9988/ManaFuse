PauseMenu

Role: Gameplay Menu


Goal: 

The PauseMenu is, as the name goes, the script which will handle the pause menu. It'll handle freezing the current game state, providing an options menu, and
a way to exit the back to the main menu. Other functions like a deck database and other useful menus may be implemented here.
