CardManager

Role: Card System Manager


Goals: 


The goal of the CardManager is to have a unified way to handle all calls to the various card systems. This abstracts calls away from specific
scripts and functions, allowing for a more modular design that flows in an easy to understand way. 

All incoming calls to the card system will be handled by CardManager, instead of hardcoding; so if aspects of the script change, or if multiple scripts
within this system are required to be called, all of it will be handled in a transparent manner by CardManager.
