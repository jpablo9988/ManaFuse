DeckHandler

Role: Deck Manager


Goal: 

The goal of the DeckHandler is to keep track of the current deck, process of discarding, drawing, and adding cards, as well as any commands sent to the deck
such as forcing a reshuffle of the deck, or shuffling a set of cards before placing them into a certain position within the deck. 

Specific functions should be programmed on a case-by-case basis if we do intend on implementing them, but ALL Deck operations should be kept here.


Current Functions:
