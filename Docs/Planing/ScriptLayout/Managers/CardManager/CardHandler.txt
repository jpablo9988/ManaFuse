CardHandler

Role: Card Handler


Goal:

Essentially, this is the replacement for the current state of CardManager, for handling the remaining functions not replicated by other scripts.
In order to ensure that we aren't creating additional paths, CardHandler will make extensive use of the new CardManager to call scripts within the 
card system. This may feel a bit awakrd, but this results in the same flexibility as any script within the codebase.

Functions being replicated are as such:

Drawing a card to a slot
Sending a call to the HUDManager to update the loaded slots (pass on which cards are equipped directly to the HUDManager)
Activating cards
Ensuring if a slot is available (to be loaded, or to be activated)


Current Functions: 
N/A
