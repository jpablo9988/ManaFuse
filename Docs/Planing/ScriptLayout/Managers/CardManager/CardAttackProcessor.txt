CardAttackProcessor

Role: Card Processor

Goal:

The idea behind the CardAttack processor is to have a single script which dictates how all attack cards will work in the game. 
When a card is set to type "Attack", arguements will be passed to this script via CardManager which define how the attack will function.
Currently, the only attack type is "Shoot Projectile", though future attack types can be implemented here as needed.


Previous functions to port over:

[ShootProjectile] (From Attackmanager)
