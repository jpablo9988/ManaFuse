UILayer

Role: Menu Input Layer


Goal:

The UILayer will act as the universal input layer for all UI interactions. Because of this, organization and categorization within
this script is crucial.

Disabling or enabling of other inputs outside of this layer should be handled naturally like all other scripts through the InputManager.
DO NOT implement cross talk between layers, as this ruins the heiarchy and organization process (along with it's benefits).
