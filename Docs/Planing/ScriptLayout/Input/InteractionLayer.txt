InteractionLayer

Role: Misc Input Layer


Goal:

The InteractionLayer acts as a unorganized input layer for the player that doesn't fit into any specific categories, but doesn't fit into it's own
dedicated layer.

This layer can be used for things like in-level interactables, game-world button prompts, debug keybinds, etc
