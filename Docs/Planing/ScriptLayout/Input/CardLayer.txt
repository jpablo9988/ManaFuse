CardLayer

Role: Card Input Manager

Changes from previous version:

Implements similar function as CardInputHandler. 
For the most part, it stays the same, though we might want to have new functions that switch between different control sets
such as when we want to switch between the "Normal" and "Simplified" reloading mechanics


Goal: 

The goal of our input layers, is to provide a simple, and easy to use reference for all the different elements that makeup the controls,
and allow for an easy way to modify, enable, or disable sets of controls without even having to reference them directly (only referencing
the input manager).

The CardLayer is no different, and is built to handle all controls related to card and deck inputs.
