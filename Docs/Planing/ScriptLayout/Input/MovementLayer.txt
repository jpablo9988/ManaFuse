MovementLayer

Role: Player Movement Input layer


Goal: 

Similar to all other input layers, the goal of the movement layer is to group all input keys for binds related to movement.
This includes dashing, powerups not related to the card system, aiming, etc.

Similar to the CardLayer, we may want groups of inputs to be enabled and disabled to allow us to switch between different modes.
For example, If went want to allow for mouse aiming instead of purely keyboard aiming, we could setup the binds for that here and switch which keys
are enabled or disabled; or even allow for a modifier key to toggle the input layers on the fly.
