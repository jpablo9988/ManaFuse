InputManager

Role: Input layer handler


Goal: 


The goal for the InputManager is to act as an intermediate between all other input layers. This simplifies the process of disabling or calling upon
multiple input layers at once, and also allows us to do full input layer interactions without having to hard code them in on each script that requires
such a funciton.

For the most part, the InputManager will only be handling incoming calls from scripts outside of the input subsystem, so the implementation of this
script might be rather minimal
