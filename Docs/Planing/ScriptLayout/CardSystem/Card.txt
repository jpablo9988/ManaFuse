Card

Role: Card Scriptable Object Base


Goal: 

The goal of the card system is largely the same as it was previously: to provide a clear base file, where all existing cards will base their data off of.
This allows us to have a universal script which all objects of the same type are built off of; instead of having seperate scripts for each card.

Card objects are merely tools to define what a card does, and it's metadata like Icon, Name, Mana Usage, etc.
Actual functionality of the cards are implemented in related scripts, what functions are called and their parameters are dictated by this file.



Previous functions to port over:

Since this is more of a datafile, the card file will remain untouched
