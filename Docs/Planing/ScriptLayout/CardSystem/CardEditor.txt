CardEditor

Role: Scriptable Object Editor


Goals:


CardEditor is built to provide a simple UI in-editor to modify values for a given card file. All parameters for the card should be able to be selected 
via a mixture of drop downs, bools, and object selections; making card creation quick and easy.

All actual functionality should be supplied by supporting scripts, where as edited cards simply define arguments for these script functions.


Previous functions to port over:

CardEditor can remain untouched for now, as it's purely an editor element.


Current Functions:

[OnEnable]

Read current values for the select card


[OnInspectorGUI]

Initialize and draw the editor UI elements for the card editor
