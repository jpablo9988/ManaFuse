GameContext

Role: Top level manager

Changes from previous version:

All previous links to managers need to be adjusted to their new versions, otherwise, if the manager it refers to still exists, it should be fine.


Goal: 

The goal for the GameContext is to have a unified way to handle calls from all of our scripts, and send them to the correct manager

The workflow for this process should be a such:

[Script] Calls the game context directly upon a certain event, state, or value change (This does NOT have to go through a manager,
anything can call the game context directly)

[Game Context] Recieves said call, and passes this call down to the correct manager(s)

[Manager] Processes said call, and triggers the correct functions in the scripts that it handles


This process allows us to abstract calls between scripts into a more consistent workflow. This allows us, at any point in time to accurately
and consistently follow calls from any script and modify the behavior in a clean way.
For example, if I need to add additional triggers when a card is activated, all I need to do is to create the script or function I need within
it's related folder, and modify the manager entry to properly execute my new script/function
Now any script that calls card activation through game context will trigger my new function, simplifying the workflow of new additions
